The roboRIO has a basic architecture of a Real-Time processors + FPGA (field programmable gate array)
- reconfigurable robotics controller that includes built-in ports for 
	- inter-integrated circuits (I2C)
	- serial peripheral interfaces (SPI)
	- RS232
	- USB
	- Ethernet
	- pulse width modulation (PWM)
	- relays to quickly 
- to connect the common sensors and actuators used in robotics

Controller features:
- LEDs, buttons, an onboard accelerometer, and a custom electronics port
- Onboard dual-core ARM real-time Cortexâ€‘A9 processor and customizable Xilinx FPGA.
